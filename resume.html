                    <h3>bpirrocco.dev</h3>
                    <p><em>Built with: Pure HTML, SASS, and JavaScript</em></p>
                    <p>
                        My developer website, home to various CSS and JavaScript experiments. This is a static
                        website, hosted on AWS using S3. I have taken advantage of services such as API Gateway,
                        Lambda, and DynamoDB to provide additional functionality, like the visit counter you see
                        above. This site acts as a hub for the following projects, some which have been containerized 
                        and are running on AWS. Feel free to pay it a <a href="bpirrocco.dev" class="inline">visit</a>!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wavar√©</h3>
                    <p><em>Built with: Python, Django, HTML, SASS, pandas, Meteomatics API</em></p>
                    <p>
                        Web app developed using Django framework. I created this app to display big wave
                        forecasts for several beaches across Portugal. I developed two versions of this app,
                        one that acts more as a CMS, with a custom library made to generate simulated forecasts
                        for the locations, and the other pulling real time wave height forecasts from Meteomatics.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Jomboy Podcast Aggregator</h3>
                    <p><em>Built with: Python, Django, feedparser, HTML, Bootstrap</em></p>
                    <p>
                        This web app pulls in information about the podcasts produced by the independent
                        media company, Jomboy Media. Users can register for an account where they choose some of
                        their favorite Jomboy podcasts, topics, and content-creators, and the app will give them
                        suggestions for other content from the company.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nova Band Website</h3>
                    <p><em>Built with: Javascript, React, Node.js, </em></p>
                    <p>
                        Website for my New Jersey-based cover band. This site allows booking agents and fans to contact 
                        us, view our upcoming events, and give song suggestions. There is also a member portion of the 
                        site for the band members. Here we can share our personal schedules and collaborate on arrangements
                        from anywhere.
                    </p>
                    <h3>JP Bender Design New Music Chart</h3>
                    <p><em>Built with: PHP, Twig, spotifyapi</em></p>
                    <p>
                        This project is a collaboration between me and JP Bender, a Philadelphia-based graphic designer.
                        It is an interactive showcase of a "Best Albums and Songs of the Year" list that he creates
                        every year. The site pulls tracks and album art from Spotify using their API.
